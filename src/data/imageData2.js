This level of preservation is sometimes referred to as mummy cells and in this case reveals the progression of the cells filipodia extending into the canaliculi (submicron sized tubes connecting osteocytes within the bone matrix).  Located within a lacuna we can see dehydrated granular cytoplasm making up the body of the cell.  The lacuna is described as a small chamber in the mineralized bone that holds the Osteocyte (cell).  Small amounts of migrating carbon atoms can be seen between the cytoplasm and the lacuna wall.  The clean and smooth walls of the canaliculi indifferential interference contrastate almost no degradation.  Fossil bone samples found in this Carboniferous coal shale are considered to be 350 million years old (myo)."
