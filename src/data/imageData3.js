The endostial walls of the lacuna and caliculi are lightly colored with a turally occurring ferrous oxide stain.  The four lighter colored inclusions within the lacuna (main cell body) are likely mineralized fatty acids (sometimes referred to as grave wax).  Along the inside lining of the cell (lacuna) are darker stained gas bubbles.  This extensive network of caliculi is in many cases still connected with surrounding osteocytes.  Inside the tiny tubes are found the occasional particulate matter of organic congestion now permineralized in place.  The outstretched web of caliculi is nearly complete and ultered, suggesting unusual preservation.",

Aust Cliff is located within Gloucestershire, near Avon, situated on the southern side of the Severn River Estuary. This is one of the most famous exposures of Triassic rocks in the world. The tooth shows signs of wear such as tumbling on marine bottom sediments. To the right is a small grain of quartz. The background is composted of fractured limestone matrix.",

        "description": "This is a transverse section of a fossil fish rib bone with a calcified central Haversian cal. Extending out from the endostial wall of the cal are caliculi that at one time provided nutrients to the osteocytes. As the result of extensive diagenesis the caliculi have been converted to iron disulfide and now appear as black squiggly lines. There can be seen a primary lamellae around the large cal that is lined with fossil osteocytes. Calcite fills most of the volume of the cal; however, embedded throughout are tiny pyritized framboids (Iron disulfide). The source of the iron is likely fossil blood clots reduced into an isometric pattern.",

        "description": "Fossil fish tooth mounted in Carboniferous coal shale, the sample is labeled as a Gyraconthus, denticle. The Gyracanthides are a rather large acanthodian, some reaching the length of nearly 4 feet. The pectoral fin spines are characteristically very large compared to its body. They are considered closely related to the Chondrichthyans. Down the central axis of the right branch is a vascular cal still packed with a fossil blood-clot. The sample was found in Carboniferous English coal shale.",

        "description": "This is a section through North English coal shale containing scattered Remnants of Rhizodontida, a Carboniferous class of fish, (order; Rhizodontiformes) (family; Rhizodontidae). The specific species is unknown but thought to be Rhizodus hibberti (1864). The fossil fragments consist of fish spines, scales, tusk and dermal skeletal tissues. A characteristic feature is that Rhizodonta have deeply rooted teeth and are rarely found articulated. In this small fragment are found exceptiolly preserved osteocytes, with clean caliculi still connected to surrounding companion cells. This image illustrates a dense network of exceptiolly preserved osteocytes. Inside the lacuna the progression of decay can be seen in the early stage of protein separation. As peptides brake down, the lighter fatty acids become separate from the darker nucleic acids. The surrounding and unbroken apatite continues to seal off and shielded the osteocytes from bacteria,  H2O, and oxygen. Preservation is aided by the coal shale that provides historically low oxygen content. However, Carboniferous cells should not have by any means survived the heat and radiation of this kind of extended geological time. The source of this sample is from the Carboniferous low main coal shale, Northumberland, UK. To see multiple images stacked, see: I.D.No.162.",

Inside the cal can be seen what looks like surviving erythrocytes (blood cells). These small red structures are within the range of 8 to 10 microns in diameter. As this time there is not yet any iron or pyrite framboids associated with these red cell structures. The location from which this tooth comes is the Abbey Wood deposits in London, England, UK. This fossil site is of Eocene deposits. MSSC 22.11-1.",

Most of a dermal skeleton is composed of odontogenic tissue and in this case the gold zones are a cosmine like dentine that makes up the interl structures of the tubercles. Each tubercle has its own network of interl cavities often permineralized with a cryptocrystalline silicate. The exterl surface of each tubercle has been stained by a small amount of migrating carbon from the surrounding coal deposit. The sample is from Carboniferous coal shale, Northumberland, UK.",

Most of a dermal skeleton is composed of odontogenic tissues and in this case a cosmine like dentin which makes up the interl structure of the tubercles. Here we use crossed polarized light and a 1st order red compensator which are now producing interference colors. By rotating the sample we can determine that the tubercles exhibit pleochroism. In this case the red shades may orient in one direction while the yellow-green in the other. If rotated 80 to 90 degrees the colors with switch illustrating the characteristic of pleochroism. This reaction can also be used to identify Remnants of collagen in other fossil and extant tissues. This sample is from Carboniferous coal shale, Northumberland, UK.
