        description: `001, 22.5-8. Fossil fish bone, Osteocyte; Histological longitudinal thin-section. BF, 900x. A nearly perfectly preserved osteocyte found in a longitudinal section of spongy bone (Aspidin). It was found in a fish fossil embedded in Carboniferous coal shale (Northumberland, UK). This level of preservation is sometimes referred to as mummy cells and in this case reveals the progression of the cells filipodia extending into the canaliculi (submicron sized tubes connecting osteocytes within the bone matrix). Located within a lacuna we can see dehydrated granular cytoplasm making up the body of the cell. The lacuna is described as a small chamber in the mineralized bone that holds the Osteocyte (cell). Small amounts of migrating carbon atoms can be seen between the cytoplasm and the lacuna wall. The clean and smooth walls of the canaliculi indicate almost no degradation. Fossil bone samples found in this Carboniferous coal shale are considered to be 350 million years old (myo). 900x, MSSC B22, 5-8.`

This image illustrates a well connected community of osteocytes found within the bone matrix. The connections are made of tiny tubes called canaliculi and in life are occupied by the filipodia of the living cell (cytoplasm extensions). Canaliculi are very delicate structures that are typically less the 2 microns in diameter and should not theoretically survive long geological ages of time. The clean and smooth walls of the cells and canaliculi indicate almost no degradation.
